		<p><span style="font-style:underline; font-weight:bolder">When you are making a web page you should always use a non-breaking-space when mentiioning an official company or an important name. Like the&nbsp;American&nbsp;Motorcycle&nbsp;Association. You never want an importand name to have to wrap, so remember to use a non-breaking space. You can see an example in this text, you just might have to adjust the size of your window.</p>
