	&copy; <p id="text2"> On this page I have used a couple of HTML entities. An HTML entity is, very simply put, 
				code that ler's you display special characters. An &entity_name is the text version of
				code that displays the special character&diams; An &entity_number is code for the same
				characters as the &entity_name, except the &entity_number consists of numbers instead 
				of letters. More browsers support &entity_numbers. &spades; The text-shadow property
				allows one to put shadows behind text. As you can see here. &AElig;
